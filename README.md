# Android-projects
Repository for Android apps from my projects and Labs I have completed at AUT. 

##AppLaunch - This is a simple android app that converts temperature from Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice verse. This was completed during Lab 1 of my Software-Development-Practices paper at AUT.

##TweeterSearchApp - This app takes a search query from the user and uses it to form a twitter search query. It then displays the results. Completed during Lab 2 of my Software-Development-Practices paper at AUT.
